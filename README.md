# Cloud Computing: Introduction to GitHub Version Control

## Overview
This repository demonstrates foundational GitHub usage for version control in cloud environments. Built for Vincent Mbandu Ochango's Cloud Computing unit (Fall 2025). GitHub enables collaborative, distributed code management—essential for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CDK.

## Key Files
- `cloud_sample.py`: A simple Python script simulating cloud resource allocation (e.g., prints EC2 instance stats).
- `.gitignore`: Excludes unnecessary files for repo cleanliness.

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-computing-version-control-assignment.git`
2. Run sample: `python cloud_sample.py`
3. Contribute: Fork, branch (`git checkout -b feature/cloud`), PR.

## Learnings
- **Version Control Benefits**: Atomic commits track changes like audit logs in cloud compliance (e.g., SOC 2).
- **Cloud Tie-In**: Integrates with GitHub Actions for automated deploys to Azure/AWS—next assignment teaser.
- Submitted: November 5, 2025 (pre-deadline polish).
